# ***Polymorphic Java CLI Calculator***

This is my first official implementation of a polymorphic class in Java to create a basic CLI calculator in Java.
It includes basic error handling, and works without issues.
This project was created as a class research exercise, I will however create a GUI to make it more accessible.

## **I really hope you enjoy my code.**

### **Side note:**
*Devision acts out somewhat, for example: 5 / 2 gives an answer of 3.0. (Currently doing research on correcting this error.*
